# Polynomial Regression with Linear regression and Gradient Descent & Visualization  
This repository contains an implementation of Polynomial Regression, starting from Simple Linear Regression and progressing to higher-degree models with custom degree selection. The code includes data generation, model training, evaluation, and visualization to demonstrate the effectiveness of polynomial regression over linear regression for non-linear data.  

# ðŸš€ Key Features:  
âœ… Generate Random Non-Linear Data  
âœ… Train Simple Linear Regression â€“ Fit a linear model and evaluate its RÂ² score (which performs poorly).  
âœ… Apply Polynomial Regression (Degree 2) â€“ Transform features, retrain the model, and observe an improved RÂ² score.  
âœ… Implement Gradient Descent â€“ Optimize the polynomial model using a custom gradient descent algorithm.  
âœ… Custom Degree Function â€“ Train polynomial regression for any specified degree dynamically.  
âœ… 3D Data & Visualization â€“ Extend the approach to 3D datasets, train both simple and polynomial regression models, and visualize predictions with interactive plots.
